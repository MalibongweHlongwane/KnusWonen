## 📱 Responsive Design Approach

### Strategy: Tailwind CSS Utilities with Custom Media Queries

The responsive implementation follows **Approach #3** from the assessment criteria:

1. **Tailwind CSS Responsive Utilities**

   ```tsx
   // Example from HeroSection.tsx
   <h1 className="text-4xl lg:text-5xl xl:text-6xl font-bold text-white leading-tight mb-8">
     Woningen krimphalen is helpen!
   </h1>
   ```

2. **Custom Breakpoints**

   ```css
   /* globals.css - Custom responsive variables */
   :root {
     --desktop-width: 1512px;
     --tablet-max: 1199px;
     --mobile-max: 768px;
   }
   ```

3. **Flexible Grid System**
   - Desktop: Fixed 1512px width with exact positioning
   - Tablet: Responsive grid layout (768px - 1199px)
   - Mobile: Single column stack (< 768px)

### Responsive Features

- **Mobile-First Design** - Progressive enhancement from mobile to desktop
- **Flexible Images** - Next.js Image component with responsive sizing
- **Adaptive Typography** - Scales appropriately across screen sizes
- **Touch-Friendly** - Interactive elements optimized for mobile

## 🎯 Assessment Criteria Compliance

### 1. Project Setup ✅

- Next.js 15 with TypeScript properly configured
- Tailwind CSS v4 integrated with custom variables
- Clear project structure with component organization
- Best practices for file naming and folder structure

### 2. Pixel-Perfect Implementation ✅
I tried my best, willing to learn, would have done better if I had enough time.
### 3. Responsive Design ✅

- Tailwind CSS utilities for responsive breakpoints
- Custom media queries where needed
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Flexible grid system adapting to screen sizes

### 4. Code Quality ✅

- Clean, well-documented TypeScript code
- Readable and maintainable component structure
- Proper Next.js development practices
- Component decomposition and reusability

### 5. Designer Feedback ✅

-Have you considered color contrast ratios for accessibility?
-Should I implement any specific ARIA attributes?
-The design only includes desktop version. Could you provide mobile and tablet mockups?

1. The curved purple background in the hero section is not easy to replicate in Tailwind using standard utilities — I would recommend providing the SVG curve or gradient asset.

2. Font styles (e.g., button text weight and size) could be documented with exact Tailwind-compatible values (e.g., `text-sm`, `font-semibold`).

3. For hover states, I assumed the buttons and cards have simple background or shadow transitions, but a hover design or prototype would help clarify behavior.

4. The newsletter section uses a complex gradient and abstract illustration — it would be helpful to have a style guide or brand color list to accurately match them.


### Final Comments:
As someone with experience in Angular and Bootstrap5, I enjoyed working on this using React and TailwindCSS. This challenge helped me learn responsive Tailwind layouts, component structuring in Next.js, and working from Figma designs. I am confident that with mentorship and feedback, I’ll quickly become productive with this stack.
